//Options:
//1. One thread created
//2. Two thread created
//3. Depend upon system
//4. No thread created
// The answer is option (1)
//Explanation : In the above program only one thread will be created i.e. the main thread which is responsible to execute the main() method only. The run() method is called by the object t like a normal method.
