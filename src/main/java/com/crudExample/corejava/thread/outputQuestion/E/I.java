//Options:
//1. Run
//2. Main
//3. Compile time error
//4. Run Main
//
//Output:
//
// The answer is option (2)
//Explanation : In the above program, we are calling start() method of Thread class which is responsible to execute run() method of Thread class and Thread class run() method has empty implementation. Thatâ€™s why one child thread will be created but it will not execute Test class run() method.
