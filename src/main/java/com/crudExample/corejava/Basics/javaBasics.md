# Java Programming Language

## 1. What is Java?

Java is a simple, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be easy to write, compute, and debug. It enables developers to create modular programs and reusable code.

- **Simple**: Java is easy to learn and use, making it accessible for beginners and efficient for experienced developers.
- **Object-Oriented**: Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, promoting modular and reusable code.
- **Write Once, Run Anywhere**: Java's platform independence means that code written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## 2. Features of Java

Java boasts several powerful features that contribute to its widespread use:

1. **Platform Independent**: Java is platform-independent at both the source and binary levels, which means that Java code can be written once and run anywhere.
2. **Object-Oriented**: Java treats everything as an object, encapsulating data and behavior into classes and objects.
3. **Simple**: The syntax of Java is clean and easy to understand, making it easier to write, compile, and debug programs.
4. **Secure**: Java provides a secure execution environment by managing memory access, ensuring that code runs in a controlled and safe manner.
5. **Robust**: Java emphasizes reliability by providing strong memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection.
6. **Multithreaded**: Java supports multithreading, allowing developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
7. **Portable**: The portability of Java is one of its most significant advantages. Java code can be executed on any platform without requiring modifications.
8. **High Performance**: Although Java is an interpreted language, the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers allows Java to achieve high performance.

## 3. History of Java

Java was developed by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems (which was later acquired by Oracle) in 1991. The language was initially called **Oak** after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later, the project was renamed **Green** and finally, it became **Java**.

Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language gained popularity in the 1990s due to its ability to write applets and applications for the World Wide Web.

**Timeline**:
- **1991**: Java's development begins.
- **1995**: Java 1.0 was released, providing a platform-independent language with the promise of "Write Once, Run Anywhere."
- **2004**: Java 5 introduces significant updates like generics and annotations.
- **2010**: Oracle acquires Sun Microsystems.
- **2021**: Java SE 17 is released, featuring long-term support and various enhancements.

## 4. Difference Between C++ and Java

Java and C++ are both object-oriented programming languages, but they have several differences in terms of design philosophy, features, and usage.

| Feature                       | C++                                               | Java                                             |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Platform Dependency**       | Platform-dependent (compiled to machine code).    | Platform-independent (compiled to bytecode).     |
| **Memory Management**         | Manual memory management using pointers.          | Automatic memory management with garbage collection. |
| **Multiple Inheritance**      | Supports multiple inheritance through classes.    | Does not support multiple inheritance through classes, but supports it through interfaces. |
| **Syntax**                    | More complex, with features like pointers, operator overloading, and templates. | Simplified, with no pointers, operator overloading, or templates. |
| **Performance**               | Generally faster due to closer hardware interaction. | Slightly slower due to the use of JVM, though JIT compilation improves performance. |
| **Exception Handling**        | Optional, more manual management of exceptions.   | Mandatory, with robust built-in exception handling mechanisms. |
| **Libraries and APIs**        | Standard Template Library (STL) for generic programming. | Rich set of APIs and a large standard library that supports modern web and enterprise applications. |
| **Memory Access**             | Direct access to memory using pointers.           | No direct access to memory, providing better security. |
| **Object-Oriented**           | Partially object-oriented, supports both procedural and OOP styles. | Fully object-oriented, everything is treated as an object. |
| **Compilation**               | Compiled directly into machine code.              | Compiled into bytecode, which is interpreted by the JVM. |
| **Use Cases**                 | System-level programming, game development, real-time systems. | Web applications, mobile applications, enterprise software. |

This Markdown file provides a clear and concise overview of Java, its features, history, and a comparison with C++. Let me know if you need any more details or further assistance!



q. public static void main(String arg[]){}
public: Jvm call the .class file from another package
static: main method call without creating an object.
void: main method has no return type.
String args[]: It is command line argument.

Q. System.out.println("Hello");
--> System is class.
--> Out is static final print string reference variable.
--> print() is a non static method.

Q. How to set path in Java?

Q. Explain JDK, JRE and JVM?
JDK: jre+ DevelopmentKit
java development kit.
It is used develop to code write and run program.
It consists of develop kit with jre.

JRE: Java runtime environment 
JRE: JVM+liberty Set


JVM: java virtual Machine
Jvm read .class file and give output

Q. JVM Memory Management
1. Stack
2. Heap

--> Program execution flow in maintain stack.
--> All the object in Java created in Heap.
--> Non-static and static variable are stored in Meta space.
--> Local and non-static variable in Heap.

Q. ClassLoader:
classloader is abstract class.--> java.lang.package
classloader is a subsystem of jvm which is used to load class files.
whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by class loader.

1. Bootstrap class loader
2. Extension class loader
3. System/application class loader


Q. Why Java is platform Independent language?
when .java file compile into .class file it converted into byte code by jit compiler and this byte code can use any platform because of jvm.

Q. What is JIT compiler in JAVA?
-> The JUST-IN-TIME is a component of the jre that improve the performance of java application at run time.
--> It helps improve the performance of java programs by compiling bytes codes into native machine code at runtime.

Q. Why Java is not pure object oriented language?

Because of primitive data type java is not 100% object oriented programming language.

Q. What is Garbage collection?
--> Regular bases of unease object store in ram.
--> To avoiding overflow of memory.
--> Help to manage the memory efficient.

Here's a brief summary on the concept of Wrapper classes in Java:

### Wrapper Class in Java

A Wrapper class in Java provides a way to use primitive data types (like `int`, `char`, etc.) as objects. Each primitive type has a corresponding Wrapper class in the `java.lang` package:

- `int` -> `Integer`
- `char` -> `Character`
- `float` -> `Float`
- `double` -> `Double`
- `long` -> `Long`
- `short` -> `Short`
- `byte` -> `Byte`
- `boolean` -> `Boolean`

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Wrapping (Boxing)**:
  - **Definition**: The process of converting a primitive data type into its corresponding Wrapper class object.
  - **Example**:
    ```java
    int a = 5;
    Integer aObj = Integer.valueOf(a); // Boxing
    ```

2. **Unboxing**:
  - **Definition**: The process of converting the Wrapper class object back to its corresponding primitive data type.
  - **Example**:
    ```java
    Integer aObj = 5;
    int a = aObj.intValue(); // Unboxing
    ```

**Advantages**:
- Allows primitive data types to be used in Collections (like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`), which require objects.
- Provides utility methods for converting between data types, parsing, etc.

### Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types in Java

#### **Primitive Data Types:**
- **Definition**: Primitive data types are the most basic data types available in Java. They are predefined by the language and named by a keyword.
- **Types**: There are 8 primitive data types in Java:
    1. **byte**: 8-bit integer (`-128` to `127`)
    2. **short**: 16-bit integer (`-32,768` to `32,767`)
    3. **int**: 32-bit integer (`-2^31` to `2^31-1`)
    4. **long**: 64-bit integer (`-2^63` to `2^63-1`)
    5. **float**: 32-bit floating point
    6. **double**: 64-bit floating point
    7. **char**: 16-bit Unicode character
    8. **boolean**: Represents `true` or `false`

- **Characteristics**:
    - **Memory-efficient**: Primitive data types are stored in the stack memory, and they are very memory-efficient.
    - **No additional methods**: They don't come with methods.
    - **Default values**:
        - Numeric types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`) default to `0`.
        - `char` defaults to `'\u0000'` (null character).
        - `boolean` defaults to `false`.

#### **Non-Primitive Data Types:**
- **Definition**: Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are derived from the primitive types and are created by the programmer.
- **Examples**:
    1. **String**: A sequence of characters.
    2. **Arrays**: A collection of elements of the same type.
    3. **Classes**: A blueprint for creating objects (instances).
    4. **Interfaces**: A reference type in Java, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.

- **Characteristics**:
    - **Stored in heap memory**: The actual objects are stored in the heap, but references to these objects are stored in the stack.
    - **Can call methods**: Since they are objects, they can have methods that operate on data.
    - **Default value**: The default value for any non-primitive data type is `null`.

**Key Differences**:
- **Primitive types** are predefined in Java, while **non-primitive types** are created by the programmer.
- **Primitive types** store actual values, while **non-primitive types** store references to the objects.
- **Primitive types** are more memory efficient, while **non-primitive types** can use more memory because they reference objects in the heap.

Q. Why pointer are not used in Java?
--> A Pointer is just the address of same memory location.
--> Java does not support pointer explicitly but java used pointer implicitly.
--> Java use pointer for manipulation of reference but there pointer are not available for outside used.
--> any operation implicity done by the langualge is actually not visible.

Q. What are out of memory error in Java?
A runtime error in java which occurs when the java virtual machine is unable to allocated an object due to insufficient space in the java heap.

Q. Cloning?
The Process of creating the replicable of a particular object by coping the context of one object completly into another object.
