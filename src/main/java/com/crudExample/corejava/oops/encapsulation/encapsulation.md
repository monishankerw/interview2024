 1. What is an encapsulation in Java?
 --> Wrapping of data with a method that operate on the data is called as encapsulation.
 --> Here we avoid direct access to data by making variable private.
 --> To Operate on data we create publicly  define getter and setter.
 2. Advantage
 --> Control Access to data validate Values.
 --> Before modification make read only or write only class.
 3. DataHiding
 --> Here we make the variable private so variable cannot be access outside class.
 --> Data hiding applicable only one variable and not method.
 4. How to achieve encapsulation in Java?
 --> Declare the variable of a class as private.
 --> Provide public Setter and Getter methods to modify and view the variable 
 5. What is Get and Set Method?
 -->The get method returns the variable value and the set method set the value.
 6. Benefits of Encapsulation. 
 --> Dats Hiding
 --> Increased Flexibility
 --> Reusability
