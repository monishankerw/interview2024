HashSet

          HashSet:
->It will contains only unique element.
-> Does not maintain insertion order.
-> Not Synchronized and not thread safe
->This class permitted(store) null elements.
->It is used Hashing to inject data into data base.
->Does not have key value pair.(only key).
->not allow Duplicate value.
->a.add(obj);
->1 object required.
->extends HashSet class.
->implement set, cloneable and serializable interface.
->Hash Set internally created HashMap.


Q. How to HashSet internally work?
Internally, it uses a HashMap to store its elements.
     1. The HashSet uses a HashMap internally where each element is stored as a key with a constant dummy value.
     2. The hash code of an element determines the index of the bucket where it will be stored.
     3. Collisions are handled by using linked lists or balanced trees within the buckets.
     4. Before adding a new element, HashSet checks for duplicates using the equals() method to ensure all elements are unique.

HashSet vs LinkedHashSet

HashSet
1. HashSet does not maintain insertion order.
2. HashSet internally map HashMap.

LinkedHashSet
1. LinkedHashSet maintain insertion order.
2. LinkedHashSet internally map LinkedHashMap.
