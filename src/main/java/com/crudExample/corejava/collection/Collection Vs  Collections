Collection: Any group of individual objects which are represent as a single unit is know as a collection of objects.
       ->It is an interface.
       ->It stores serveral an object as single entily.
       ->Collection gives us radimate data structure.
       ->Size of collection is dynamics.
       ->store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
       ->memory more efficient.
       ->He got underlying data structure to simplify our work.
       ->java.util.collection(jdk1.2)

       1. Difference between Collection and Collections.
       Collection
       ->It is an interface.
       ->It stores serveral an object as single entily.

       Collections
       ->It is a class.
       ->It is a utility class that's helps us to perform operations like sorting,searching on object present inside collection.

       2. Difference between Array and Collections.
       Array
       ->It is fixed size.
       ->Store only homogeneous data.
       ->Memory usage it is less efficient.
       ->No underlying data structure.

       Collection
       ->Size of collection is dynamics.
       ->store both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
       ->memory more efficient.
       ->He got underlying data structure to simplify our work.
