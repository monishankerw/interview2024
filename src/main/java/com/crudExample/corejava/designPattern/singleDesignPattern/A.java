    //How to Design/create a singleton class in Java?
    // 1. Ensure that only one instance of class exists.
    // 2. Provide global access to that instance By:
    //Declaring all constructors of the class to be private
    //Providing a static method that return a reference of the instance
    //Lazy initialization concept is used to write the static method.
    //3. The instance is stored as a private static variable.
    //EX: Runtime class,Action Servlet,Service Locator
