Selection Sort: Step-by-Step Explanation
Selection Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. Here’s a breakdown of how it works, step by step, using the provided Java code as a reference.

Working Principle of Selection Sort
Divide the Array into Two Parts:
A sorted sublist on the left, which starts empty and grows one element at a time.
An unsorted sublist on the right, containing the remaining elements.
Find the Minimum (or Maximum) Element:
In each iteration, the algorithm scans the unsorted part to find the smallest element.
Swap the Element:
The smallest element is swapped with the leftmost unsorted element, effectively growing the sorted sublist by one element.
Repeat:
The boundaries between the sorted and unsorted sublists are adjusted, and the process repeats until the entire array is sorted.
Time Complexity: O(n²)
Best, Average, and Worst Case: O(n²) because the algorithm always performs n-1 passes, making it inefficient for large lists.
Selection Sort Code Explanation
Here’s the code:

java
Copy code
public class SelectionSort {
    public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;

        // Traverse the array from the first element to the second last element
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {

            // Assume the first unsorted element is the smallest
            int minIndex = i;

            // Traverse the unsorted part of the array to find the smallest element
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                    minIndex = j;  // Update the index of the smallest element
                }
            }

            // Swap the found smallest element with the leftmost unsorted element
            int temp = arr[minIndex];
            arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }
}
Step-by-Step Breakdown
Initialization:
n = arr.length;: This stores the length of the array.
The outer loop for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {} iterates through the array, with i representing the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts.
Finding the Minimum Element:
The algorithm assumes that the smallest element in the unsorted part is at the index i (int minIndex = i;).
The inner loop for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {} scans the rest of the array to find the smallest element. If a smaller element is found, the index minIndex is updated (minIndex = j;).
Swapping:
After the inner loop completes, the smallest element is now at minIndex.
A swap occurs between the smallest element (arr[minIndex]) and the element at index i (arr[i]), effectively moving the smallest element to the sorted part of the array.
Repeat:
The outer loop continues, incrementing i by 1 and shrinking the unsorted part of the array until the entire array is sorted.
Example Walkthrough
Consider sorting the array [64, 25, 12, 22, 11].

First Pass (i = 0):
Initial array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Smallest element in unsorted sublist: 11
Swap 11 with 64
Array after swap: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]
Second Pass (i = 1):
Initial array: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]
Smallest element in unsorted sublist: 12
Swap 12 with 25
Array after swap: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]
Third Pass (i = 2):
Initial array: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]
Smallest element in unsorted sublist: 22
Swap 22 with 25
Array after swap: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
Fourth Pass (i = 3):
Initial array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
Smallest element in unsorted sublist: 25
No swap needed as 25 is already in the correct position.
Final sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

Key Points to Remember
Selection Sort is easy to implement but inefficient for large lists due to O(n²) complexity.
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).
It performs well on small lists and is simple to understand.
Selection Sort makes fewer swaps than Bubble Sort, but it is still not a stable sorting algorithm (i.e., it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements).

Here's the complete code for the Selection Sort algorithm in Java, including an example of how to use it:

Complete Selection Sort Code
java
Copy code
public class SelectionSort {

    // Function to perform Selection Sort
    public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;  // Get the length of the array

        // Traverse the array
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            // Assume the first unsorted element is the minimum
            int minIndex = i;

            // Find the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                    minIndex = j;  // Update the index of the minimum element
                }
            }

            // Swap the found minimum element with the first unsorted element
            int temp = arr[minIndex];
            arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }

    // Function to print the array
    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example array
        int[] arr = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};

        // Print the original array
        System.out.println("Original Array:");
        printArray(arr);

        // Perform selection sort
        selectionSort(arr);

        // Print the sorted array
        System.out.println("Sorted Array:");
        printArray(arr);
    }
}
Explanation of Code
selectionSort(int[] arr): This method sorts the input array using the Selection Sort algorithm.
printArray(int[] arr): This method prints the array's elements.
main(String[] args): This is the main method that creates an example array, prints the original array, sorts the array using Selection Sort, and then prints the sorted array.
Output of the Code
If you run the code, the output will look like this:

javascript
Copy code
Original Array:
64 25 12 22 11
Sorted Array:
11 12 22 25 64
This code demonstrates how to implement and use Selection Sort in Java. The algorithm is applied to an example array, and the result is printed before and after sorting.
