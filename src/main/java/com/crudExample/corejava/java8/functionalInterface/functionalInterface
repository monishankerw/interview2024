        a. A Functional Interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method(Incomplete method).
        b. It is also known as SAM Interface(Single Abstract Method)
        c. A Functional Interface can have any number of default and static method.
        Exam: Runnable, Camparable, ActionListener
        d. Lambda Expressions can be used and executted by representing the interface with an annotation called @FunctionalInterface.
        e. @Functional Interface annotation is used to ensure that the functional interface can not more than one abstract method.
        Ex: 1
        @FunctionalInterface
       public interface A {
           public void test();
       }

       Ex:2
       @FunctionalInterface
       public interface A {
           public void test();
           public void test1();
       }//error
