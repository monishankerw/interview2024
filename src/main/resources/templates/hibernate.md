# JPA and Hibernate Overview

## 1. What is JPA?

JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification that defines how to manage relational data in Java applications. It provides an API for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) and enables Java developers to work with databases using objects instead of SQL queries.

## 2. What is Hibernate JPA?

Hibernate is an implementation of the JPA specification. It acts as the ORM framework that translates Java objects into database tables and vice versa.

## 3. JPA Annotations

- **@Entity**: Marks a Java class as a JPA entity that maps to a database table.
- **@Table**: Specifies the table name for the entity.
- **@Column**: Maps a field in the entity to a column in the database.
- **@Id**: Specifies the primary key for the entity.
- **@GeneratedValue**: Defines the strategy for generating primary key values.

## 4. Difference Between JPA and Hibernate

- **JPA**: It is a specification that defines how ORM should be done.
- **Hibernate**: It is a framework that implements JPA and provides additional features.

## Hibernate

### 1. Hibernate

Hibernate is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) framework that allows developers to work with relational databases using Java objects.

### 2. Hibernate vs JDBC

#### JDBC

- Database connectivity technology.
- Does not support lazy loading.
- Developers need to manage database connections and transactions manually.
- Performance can be slower compared to ORM frameworks.

#### Hibernate

- Hibernate is a framework.
- Supports lazy loading.
- Automatically manages database connections and transactions.
- Provides better performance due to caching and lazy loading.

### 3. Why Hibernate Over JDBC?

Hibernate abstracts the database-specific details and allows developers to switch between databases without changing the code. It automatically handles database transactions, making it more efficient and easier to work with compared to JDBC.

### 4. What is Hibernate Framework?

- Open-source ORM framework.
- Designed to map Java objects to relational databases.
- Simplifies data persistence in Java applications.

## Advantages of Hibernate Over JDBC

1. Hibernate is an ORM tool that simplifies database operations.
2. It is open-source and widely used.
3. Supports inheritance, polymorphism, and associations.
4. Hibernate Query Language (HQL) makes it database-independent.
5. Supports lazy loading, caching, and annotations.

## Key Hibernate Concepts

### POJO

- Plain Old Java Object.
- Used in Hibernate to represent database entities.

### Dialect

- A class in Hibernate that generates SQL queries for a specific database.

### Session and SessionFactory

- **Session**: Represents a single unit of work with the database.
- **SessionFactory**: Creates sessions and provides a second-level cache.

### HQL (Hibernate Query Language)

- An object-oriented query language used to perform CRUD operations on entities.
- It is similar to SQL but operates on objects instead of tables.

### Lazy Loading

- A technique where associated data is loaded only when it is explicitly requested.

### Caching in Hibernate

- **First-Level Cache**: Maintained at the session level and accessible only within the session.
- **Second-Level Cache**: Maintained at the session factory level and available to all sessions.

### Inheritance Mapping in Hibernate

1. **Table Per Class**: Each class is mapped to a separate table.
2. **Table Per Subclass**: Subclasses are mapped to separate tables, with inheritance.
3. **Table Per Concrete Class**: Subclasses are merged into one table.

---

## Hibernate Mapping

1. **Primitive Type Mapping**: Maps Java primitive types (e.g., int, long) to database types.
2. **Date and Time Mapping**: Maps Java Date/Time objects to database types.
3. **Binary and Large Object Mapping**: Maps binary data (e.g., byte arrays) and large objects (LOBs) to database types.
4. **JDK-Related Type Mapping**: Maps classes and time zones to database types.

---

## Example: Entity and Mapping

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "students")
@Data
@ToString
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Student {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    @Column(name = "student_id")
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "student_name")
    private String name;
}
```

- **@Entity**: Defines a JPA entity.
- **@Table**: Specifies the table name as "students".
- **@Id**: Marks the field `id` as the primary key.
- **@GeneratedValue**: Specifies the primary key generation strategy as `AUTO`.
- **@Column**: Maps the `id` and `name` fields to columns in the "students" table.

---

## Common Hibernate Methods

1. **save()**: Persists a new entity to the database.
2. **update()**: Updates an existing entity in the database.
3. **delete()**: Deletes an entity from the database.
4. **merge()**: Merges the state of a detached entity into the current session.

---

## Hibernate Object States

1. **Transient State**: The object is not associated with a database session.
2. **Persistent State**: The object is associated with a database session and is saved in the database.
3. **Detached State**: The object was once associated with a session but is now disconnected.

---

## Conclusion

Hibernate simplifies working with databases by abstracting SQL and database-specific logic. It allows for easy database interaction through objects, supports advanced ORM techniques, and improves performance with features like lazy loading and caching.

              | role            |       | state             |

## SQL Code:

```sql
-- Create UserDetail Table with more fields
CREATE TABLE user_details (
    userDetailId BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phoneNumber VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(100),
    postalCode VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Create User Table with more fields
CREATE TABLE users (
    userId BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) CHECK (role IN ('Admin', 'User', 'Guest')) DEFAULT 'User',
    createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    userDetailId BIGINT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_user_detail FOREIGN KEY (userDetailId) REFERENCES user_details(userDetailId)
);

-- Insert sample data into user_details
INSERT INTO user_details (address, phoneNumber, city, state, country, postalCode)
VALUES 
    ('123 Main St', '1234567890', 'New York', 'NY', 'USA', '10001'),
    ('456 Elm St', '0987654321', 'Los Angeles', 'CA', 'USA', '90001');

-- Insert sample data into users
INSERT INTO users (username, password, email, role, userDetailId)
VALUES 
    ('john_doe', 'hashed_password1', 'john@example.com', 'Admin', 1),
    ('jane_smith', 'hashed_password2', 'jane@example.com', 'User', 2);
```

### Explanation:

1. **User Table**:
    - Added more fields such as `email`, `role`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
    - The `role` field has a constraint that only allows specific roles (`Admin`, `User`, `Guest`).
    - `createdAt` and `updatedAt` use SQL's timestamp functionality to track when the user was created and last updated.

2. **UserDetail Table**:
    - Added more fields like `city`, `state`, `country`, and `postalCode`.
    - These fields provide more detailed information about the user's location.

3. **Foreign Key Relationship**:
    - The `userDetailId` in the `users` table references the `userDetailId` in the `user_details` table, enforcing referential integrity.

This structure makes the database more versatile and robust, offering enhanced capabilities for user management and tracking.
